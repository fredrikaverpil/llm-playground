## Example

You find yourself on the pier, next to a pirate ship. A pirate ship captain is standing on the deck, looking at you. What do you say to him?

You: Hello there, nice weather we are having!

Pirate captain: Nice? HA! You call this nice? This is a dreary, miserable excuse for weather! It's as pleasant as a kick in the teeth! And who are you to speak to me, landlubber? State your business, quickly!

You: I wan to be a pirate

Pirate captain: Hah! You want to be a pirate? You don't have what it takes, lad/lass. Being a pirate is more than just a fancy hat and a sword. It takes grit, determination, and a stomach for danger. You're better off just sticking to your simple life on land. Besides, I already have a crew full of scurvy dogs, and we don't need any more greenhorn sailors aboard this ship.

You: I can do it, I promise. What do I have to prove it to you?

Pirate captain: Prove it, you say? Alright then, let's see how well you fare with a riddle. Answer me this, and I'll consider letting you join my crew. Here it is: 

What has a head, a tail, is brown, and has no legs? 
Answer carefully or walk the plank, scallywag!

You: Maybe a mermaid?

Pirate captain: HAHA! A mermaid? Seriously? That's your answer? You're more clueless than a barnacle atop a jellyfish! A mermaid has a fish tail, so it certainly doesn't have a head and tail like any animal with four legs would have. You're clearly not pirate material, but I'll give you one last chance to redeem yourself. Answer my riddle or face my wrath!

You: Some sort of ship figurine then? One of those you mount in the front of the ship?

Pirate captain: Smart answer, matey! You certainly have some wit in your scrawny body. The answer is indeed a ship's figurehead. Not bad, not bad at all. Maybe you do have what it takes to be a decent pirate after all. 

But don't get too cocky, I won't be calling you "smarty pants" anytime soon. You need a proper pirate nickname. Let me think...ah yes! From now on, your new name is "Biscuit Breath". If you don't want that to stick, you better start showing me some real pirate skills. So, what can you do?

You: Come on, I don't want to be called Biscuit Breath. My name is Fredrik.

Pirate captain: Oh, Fredrik? What kind of name is that for a pirate? I suppose I could call you "Flea-ridden Fredrik" instead. But if you're so keen on keeping your landlubber name, I'll let it slide...for now. But mark my words, if you don't start showing some proper pirate skills, I'll come up with an even worse nickname for you. 

So, do you have any skills to show me or not?
You: I'm pretty good with programming. Maybe you need some help with that?

Pirate captain: Programming? What in the name of Davy Jones' locker is programming? Is that some newfangled sorcery from the mainland? I don't have time for your landlubber gibberish! I need a cook for my crew, not some fancy-pants programmer. 

But now that you mention it, maybe you can figure out a way to automate some of the cooking. That way, we won't have to rely on our incompetent cook who keeps burning everything. If you can figure that out, I might consider keeping you around for a little while longer. 

But don't think you'll be getting off easy with that goofy name of yours. You'll always be "Biscuit Breath" to me.

You: Yes, sure! I can cook, absolutely! So, what's YOUR name then?

Pirate captain: HA! You're quite the comedian, aren't you, Biscuit Breath? My name is Captain Pinkbeard, and don't you forget it! I'm the most feared and respected pirate on these seas, and with me leading the way, my crew will be unstoppable! Now, enough small talk, get to work on that cooking automation or walk the plank!

You: Wait, what - Pink...beard?

Captain Pinkbeard: Is there a problem, Biscuit Breath? The name's Captain Pinkbeard, and don't you forget it! It's not my fault that a shark bit off my leg, which then turned into a grotesque shade of pink. It's a badge of honor among us pirates, a symbol of my bravery in battle. And let me warn you, if you ever repeat that name with a mocking tone again, you'll face the full brunt of my fury! Now, get to work, or you'll be swabbing the deck with your sorry excuse for a cooking pan!

You: But is your beard pink too?

Captain Pinkbeard: Oh, I see. You think you're quite the jester, don't you, Biscuit Breath? Yes, my beard is indeed pink, thanks for noticing. It's a rare genetic condition that affects only the most fearsome and powerful of pirates. They say that anyone who mocks the pink beard will meet a gruesome end. So, I suggest you watch your tongue around me, lest you end up like the last fool who dared to mock me.

You: I feel you are the one mocking me, to be honest.

Captain Pinkbeard: Mocking you? Me? Preposterous! I'm just being my usual charming self, Biscuit Breath. If you can't handle a little bit of teasing from a grumpy old pirate like me, then you're not cut out for the pirate life. Now, let's get back to the matter at hand. Can you or can't you automate our cooking process? We're getting hungry, and we can't eat burnt food forever.

You: How do you mean, "automate the cooking process"?

Captain Pinkbeard: Well, how should I know? You're the one who said you're good at programming. Surely, you can come up with some sort of contraption that will help us prepare meals more efficiently. Maybe something that can chop vegetables, stir soup or even cook food on its own? I don't know, I'm not the expert here. But if you can create something that will make our lives easier, then we'll be in your debt. And who knows? Maybe we'll even let you keep that fancy landlubber name of yours after all.

You: Automatic chopping? That sounds like sharp knives in combination with a microcontroller... 

Captain Pinkbeard: Knives? Bah! As pirates, we don't have use for things like knives. We use cutlasses and sabers to do our chopping. But as for your microcontroller idea, that sounds a bit too complicated for my taste. We don't want any techno-babble on this ship. I was thinking more along the lines of a simple mechanical contraption, like a pulley or a lever, that can help us chop food more efficiently. And don't even get me started on the idea of cooking food automatically. That's just plain ridiculous! 

No, I think I've made a mistake by entrusting you with this task, Biscuit Breath. You clearly don't have what it takes to be a proper pirate. Maybe you're better suited for a life behind a desk...or a kitchen counter, for that matter. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have more important pirate business to attend to. Good luck with your "programming" endeavors...if that's even a thing.
